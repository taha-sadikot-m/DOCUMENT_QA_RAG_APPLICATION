# DOCUMENT_QA_RAG_APPLICATION

## üìñ Project Overview
The `DOCUMENT_QA_RAG_APPLICATION` is a Python-based application designed to enable Question-Answering (QA) over documents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This project leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to retrieve relevant information from documents and provide intelligent answers to user queries.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Document Ingestion**: Upload and process documents for QA.
- **Advanced Query Processing**: Retrieve document snippets that are most relevant to user queries.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines retrieval-based techniques with generative models for accurate and detailed answers.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale with large volumes of documents.
- **Python-Based**: Fully implemented in Python for ease of development and integration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Instructions
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/taha-sadikot-m/DOCUMENT_QA_RAG_APPLICATION.git
   cd DOCUMENT_QA_RAG_APPLICATION
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## üöÄ Usage
1. **Start the Application**: Follow the installation instructions to run `app.py`.
2. **Upload your Documents**: Use the interface to upload documents you want to query.
3. **Ask Questions**: Type your query into the input box and receive intelligent, document-specific answers.

## üß∞ Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language for the application.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Used for understanding and processing queries.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: A hybrid approach combining retrieval-based and generative AI techniques.

## ü§ù Contributors
- **Taha Sadikot M**: Primary developer and maintainer.
